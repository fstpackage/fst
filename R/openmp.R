#' Get or set the number of threads used in parallel operations
#'
#' For parallel operations, the performance is determined to a great extend by the number of threads
#' used. More threads will allow the CPU to perform more computational intensive tasks simultaneously,
#' speeding up the operation. Using more threads also introduces some overhead that will scale with the
#' number of threads used. Therefore, using the maximum number of available threads is not always the
#' fastest solution. With \code{threads_fst} the number of threads can be adjusted to the users
#' specific requirements. As a default, \code{fst} uses a number of threads equal to the number of
#' logical cores in the system.
#'
#' The number of threads can also be set with \code{option(fst.threads = N)}.
#' NOTE: This option is only read when the package's namespace is first loaded, with commands like
#' \code{library}, \code{require}, or \code{::}. If you have already used one of these, you
#' must use \code{threads_fst} to set the number of threads.
#'
#' @param nr_of_threads number of threads to use or \code{NULL} to get the current number of threads used in
#' multithreaded operations.
#'
#' @return the number of threads (previously) used
#' @export
